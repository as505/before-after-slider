## About
Modern websites lets users compare two images side by side using fancy before and after sliders.
I wanted to learn how these sliders are implemented, and made a small web app in Next JS to recreate the effect.

I found two similar images of Bergen to use as the two pictures, one from 1930 and the other from 2005.
By draging the slider left or right, a user can compare how Bergen looks in the two images.
